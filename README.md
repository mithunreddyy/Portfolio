Personal portfolio and blog. Project case studies, an editorial blog, and an availability status. All content is Markdown in `content/`, bundled at build time. There is no database.

## Stack

- React 19, Vite, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Motion for animation
- Hanken Grotesk for text, Geist Mono for metadata
- Lucide React for icons
- Open-Meteo for the temperature shown in the blog reader
- Web3Forms for the contact form

## Editing content

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `content/profile.md` | Name, role, links, resume path. The body is the intro summary. |
| `content/skills.md` | One `##` heading per category, one bullet per skill. |
| `content/experience/*.md` | One file per role. Bullets are the highlights. |
| `content/projects/*.md` | One file per project. Bullets are the description. |
| `content/blog/<slug>.md` | One file per post. Set `published: false` to hide it. |

The number prefix on experience and project filenames (`01-`, `02-`) sets their order. Blog posts sort by date.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run lint    # type check
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` to enable the contact form.
